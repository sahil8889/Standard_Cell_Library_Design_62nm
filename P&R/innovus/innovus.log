WARNING (LEFPARS-2007): NAMESCASESENSITIVE statement is obsolete in version 5.6 and later.

To avoid this warning, and correctly handle these DRC rules, you should modify your
LEF to use the appropriate SAMENET keywords as described in the LEF/DEF 5.7
manual under the SPACING statements in the LAYER (Routing) and LAYER (Cut)
sections listed in the LEF Table of Contents. See file ../gf62.lef at line 114.
